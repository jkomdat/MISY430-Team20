Sign Me In!

Sign Me In! is an application that allows organizers to take attendance at an event quickly and electronically. Users will log into the application and enter a keyword that is given to them by the organizer. The application will track who has signed in and have this information immediately available to the organizer. We will incorporate location services, where you must be within a certain range for your Sign Me In! code to be accepted.

Our team consists of Catherine Corton, Adam Glickman, Jeff Komdat, and Jake Paston.
